Clearing Agency’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the clearing agency included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change.

The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below.

The clearing agency has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. (A) Clearing Agency’s Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change 1.

Purpose The proposed rule change would (i) revise NSCC’s Certificate of Incorporation to update NSCC’s registered agent upon whom process against NSCC may be served and (ii) update the Rules to provide an email address for sending copies of any notice to NSCC, as described in greater detail below.

Proposed Updates to NSCC’s Certificate of Incorporation NSCC’s Certificate of Incorporation currently states that the Secretary of State is NSCC’s designated agent for service of process, and that copies of any process against NSCC shall be mailed to NSCC at 55 Water Street, New York, NY 10041 (“55 Water”).

With NSCC’s upcoming departure from 55 Water, NSCC would amend its Certificate of Incorporation to appoint C T Corporation System as its registered agent upon whom process against NSCC may be served, and provide C T Corporation System’s address.

Proposed Updates to Rule 45 2 NSCC proposes to revise Section 2 of Rule 45 (Notices), which currently provides that any notice from an Interested Person to NSCC shall be sufficiently served on NSCC if the notice is in writing and delivered or mailed to NSCC at its principal place of business.

NSCC would update this section to provide an email address for sending a copy of notices to NSCC’s General Counsel’s Office. 2.

Statutory Basis Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act requires that the rules of the clearing agency be designed, inter alia, to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions.7 NSCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act.

As described above, the proposed rule change would update (i) the NSCC Certificate of Incorporation to change NSCC’s registered agent for serving process on NSCC and (ii) Rule 45 to provide an email address for sending a copy of notices to NSCC’s General Counsel’s Office.

The proposed changes are intended to update information on NSCC’s process agent and how to send notices to NSCC.

With these changes, NSCC believes its members and the public would be better informed on how best to serve NSCC, which could help promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions of those members and the public, consistent with the requirements of the Act, in particular Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act, cited above. 7 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(3)(F). 3 (B) Clearing Agency’s Statement on Burden on Competition NSCC does not believe that the proposed rule change would have any impact or impose any burden on competition because, as described above, the proposed rule change simply updates certain process and notice information and should not have any competitive impact on members or their use of NSCC services. (C) Clearing Agency’s Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received from Members, Participants, or Others NSCC has not received or solicited any written comments relating to this proposal.

If any written comments are received, NSCC will amend this filing to publicly file such comments as an Exhibit 2 to this filing, as required by Form 19b-4 and the General Instructions thereto.
