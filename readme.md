Text Extraction and Tokenization
This program extracts text from HTML and PDF files, as well as from HTML and PDF files available at a URL. It then tokenizes the extracted text using the Transformers library.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Required Python packages can be installed using pip by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run 'summarizer.py' and you will be prompted for a URL. Copy / paste the URL you want and it will summarize it for you.

Run 'test_pdf.py' or 'test_html.py' after replacing the URL with your URL of choice to have the output saved as a text file.

Just a starting point, but figured it may help someone out there.
